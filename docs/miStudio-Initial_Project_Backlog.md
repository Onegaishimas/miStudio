# **Project “MechInterp Studio”: An Agile Development Plan for AI Interpretability and Control**

## **Part 1: Architectural and System Design Deliberation**

This document outlines the proposed architecture and initial development plan for Project MechInterp Studio, a platform designed to provide unprecedented interpretability and control over Large Language Models (LLMs). The plan is the result of a simulated agile planning session, translating the product vision—a 7-step workflow for analyzing and steering LLMs—into a robust, scalable, and deployable system. The architecture is founded on a microservices paradigm, designed for containerization and cloud-native orchestration.

### **1.1 Decomposing the Workflow into Services: A Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach**

The foundation of a scalable and maintainable microservices architecture lies in correctly identifying service boundaries. Adopting the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the system's architecture will directly mirror the distinct logical domains of the 7-step workflow.1 This ensures that each microservice has high cohesion and is loosely coupled to others, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.1 Each service will be modeled around a specific business capability and will own its data, preventing the tight coupling that plagues monolithic systems.3

A critical architectural consideration emerges from analyzing the operational profiles of the workflow steps. The initial stages (Steps 1-4) involve creating the core interpretability artifacts. These are offline, data-intensive, and computationally heavy batch-processing tasks. For instance, training Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on LLM activations is a massive data engineering challenge, often involving terabytes of data and requiring complex, distributed data shuffling operations to prevent the model from learning spurious patterns.4 These workloads are characterized by high GPU and memory requirements and are run relatively infrequently (e.g., when a new LLM is to be analyzed).

In stark contrast, the later stages (Steps 5-7) are about *using* these artifacts in real-time, interactive applications. Services for correlating features, monitoring activations, and steering model outputs must be low-latency, high-concurrency, and continuously available API services. A service optimized for sub-second API responses is architecturally distinct from one designed to process terabytes of data over several hours or days.

Therefore, mixing these two disparate workload types into a single service would be a significant architectural flaw. The platform will be divided into two primary functional areas:

1. **The Offline Analysis Pipeline (Steps 1-4):** This pipeline will be implemented as a series of orchestrated, containerized jobs using a workflow engine like Kubeflow Pipelines or Argo Workflows. These tools are explicitly designed for running multi-step jobs in a containerized fashion on Kubernetes, treating each step as a task in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).5 This approach is ideal for ML training pipelines.  
2. **The Online Serving Layer (Steps 5-7):** This layer will be composed of long-running, scalable microservices deployed as Kubernetes Deployments. These services will be managed with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers to handle fluctuating user traffic and ensure high availability.6

This separation allows for the independent scaling, deployment, and optimization of each component according to its specific needs, a cornerstone of effective microservice design.8

### **1.2 Technology Stack Selection**

The choice of technology is guided by industry best practices, performance requirements, and the specific needs of AI/ML workloads. The stack is designed to be robust, scalable, and leverage the strengths of the open-source ecosystem.

* **Programming Languages & Frameworks:**  
  * **Python:** As the lingua franca of machine learning, Python will be used for all core AI and data processing tasks. The implementation will rely heavily on established libraries such as PyTorch for building and training SAEs, the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Datasets) for interacting with LLMs, and Scikit-learn for any classical ML components.9  
  * **Go (Golang):** For building high-performance, concurrent network services, Go is an ideal choice. It will be leveraged for components where low latency and high throughput are paramount, such as the API Gateway and potentially other network-intensive proxy services. The proven performance of Go-based open-source gateways like KrakenD and Tyk underscores its suitability for this role.11  
  * **Web Frameworks:** For serving ML models and other internal APIs, lightweight Python frameworks like **FastAPI** or **Flask** will be used. They provide a simple yet powerful way to expose ML models via RESTful endpoints within a containerized environment.10  
* **Data Persistence Strategy:** A polyglot persistence approach will be used, selecting the right database technology for each type of data.1  
  * **Object Storage (S3-Compatible):** An S3-compatible object store (e.g., MinIO deployed on-premise, or a cloud provider's service) will be the backbone for large-scale, unstructured data. This includes the massive text corpora used for analysis, the terabytes of LLM activation vectors, trained SAE model artifacts, and other large binary objects.4  
  * **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** For all structured metadata, PostgreSQL is the chosen solution. It will store user and project information, API keys, references to artifacts in object storage, the human-readable feature explanations, their validation scores, and associated metadata. Its transactional integrity and powerful querying capabilities are essential for managing the platform's state.  
  * **Vector Database (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone):** To power the Real-time Correlation Service, a vector database is necessary. The high-dimensional feature vectors from the trained SAE dictionary will be indexed in this database. This allows for efficient, sub-second similarity searches, enabling users to find features related to a given concept or text input quickly.  
* **Real-time Data Streaming (Apache Pulsar):** The platform requires a robust messaging system for the real-time monitoring and steering capabilities (Steps 6 and 7). This system must stream activation data from a live LLM to various consumers with low latency and high throughput. After careful consideration of the two leading platforms, Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar, **Apache Pulsar** has been selected.  
  This decision is strategic and forward-looking. While Kafka is the established standard for high-throughput event streaming 13, its architecture, which tightly couples compute and storage, presents operational challenges in multi-tenant environments.15 A commercial platform like MechInterp Studio will inevitably need to serve multiple customers (tenants), each with their own models, features, and monitoring requirements. Pulsar's multi-layered architecture, which decouples brokers (compute) from Apache BookKeeper (storage), was designed with multi-tenancy as a first-class concept.16 It provides strong resource isolation at the tenant and namespace levels, preventing a workload from one customer from impacting another.17  
  Furthermore, Pulsar is architected to efficiently handle millions of topics, a scenario that is likely as the platform grows to monitor thousands of features for hundreds of models.17 Kafka's performance can degrade under such a high topic count. Finally, Pulsar's built-in tiered storage capability, which can automatically offload older data to cheaper object storage (like S3) while keeping it queryable, is a significant operational and cost advantage for a system that will generate vast amounts of historical monitoring data.15 While Kafka may offer slightly higher raw throughput in some single-tenant benchmarks 14, Pulsar's superior architecture for multi-tenancy, massive scalability, and operational flexibility makes it the clear choice for the long-term vision of the MechInterp Studio platform.

The following tables summarize the proposed microservice architecture and technology stack.

### **1.3 API and Communication Strategy**

A well-defined communication strategy is critical for a distributed system. The platform will utilize an API Gateway to manage all external traffic and a combination of REST and gRPC for service-to-service communication.

* **API Gateway and the Kubernetes Gateway API:** All external traffic from the commercial frontend or third-party developer tools will be routed through an API Gateway. This gateway will act as a single, unified entry point, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and request routing.2 This decouples clients from the internal microservice architecture.  
  Instead of relying on the legacy and limited Kubernetes Ingress object, which often requires non-portable, vendor-specific annotations for advanced features 20, the architecture will be built upon the modern  
  **Kubernetes Gateway API**. The Gateway API is an official, next-generation Kubernetes project designed to provide a highly expressive, extensible, and role-oriented standard for managing traffic.21 It cleanly separates responsibilities: infrastructure providers define  
  GatewayClass resources, cluster operators manage Gateway resources (the actual load balancers), and application developers define Route resources (e.g., HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute) to control traffic flow to their services.22 This model aligns perfectly with an agile team structure and avoids vendor lock-in by using a portable, standardized specification supported by a growing number of implementations like Envoy Gateway and Istio.22 This is a forward-looking decision that embraces the evolution of the Kubernetes ecosystem.  
* **Inter-service Communication (REST vs. gRPC):**  
  * **REST (Representational State Transfer):** Will be the protocol of choice for all **external-facing APIs** exposed through the Gateway. Its ubiquity, statelessness, and use of standard HTTP/S make it universally accessible and easy for customers and front-end developers to consume.  
  * **gRPC:** For internal, **east-west (service-to-service) communication**, gRPC will be used. Built on HTTP/2 and using Protocol Buffers (Protobufs) for serialization, gRPC offers significantly lower latency and higher throughput than traditional JSON-over-REST communication.3 This performance is critical for the data-intensive interactions between backend services, such as the  
    Real-time Correlation Service querying the Feature Explanation Service.

### **1.4 Data Flow and Persistence Architecture**

The flow of data through the MechInterp Studio platform is central to its function. The architecture is designed to handle data at multiple scales, from massive offline corpora to real-time streams of activation vectors.

1. **Initial Data Ingestion:** The process begins when a large text corpus (e.g., C4, The Pile) is loaded into the platform's **Object Storage**.  
2. **Activation Extraction:** The Activation Ingestion Service, running as an orchestrated job, reads chunks of the corpus, passes them through a specified target LLM (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct from 24), and streams the dense activation vectors from the target layer(s) back into  
   **Object Storage**. This is a petabyte-scale operation that requires a distributed pipeline.4  
3. **SAE Training:** The SAE Training Service reads the stored activations. After a massive distributed shuffle, it trains the SAE model. The final trained model artifact (the "feature dictionary") is versioned and saved to **Object Storage**. Metadata about the training run—including hyperparameters, loss metrics, training time, and a link to the artifact—is recorded in the **PostgreSQL** database.  
4. **Feature Analysis:** The Feature Activation Service uses the trained SAE to find the top activating text snippets for each feature, storing the results in **PostgreSQL**. The Feature Explanation Service then consumes these snippets, calls an external LLM to generate explanations, and stores these explanations and their initial (unscored) metadata in **PostgreSQL**.  
5. **Scoring and Validation:** The Explanation Scoring Service creates synthetic sentences based on the explanations, runs them through the model to check for feature activation, and calculates a final confidence score. This score is then used to update the corresponding record in the **PostgreSQL** database.  
6. **Real-time Operations:** For live analysis, the Real-time Correlation Service and Feature Monitoring Service load the required SAE dictionary from Object Storage (potentially caching it in memory or loading feature vectors into the **Vector Database**). They then subscribe to a dedicated **Pulsar** topic. An instrumented LLM publishes its activation data to this topic in real-time, allowing the services to monitor and steer the model's behavior based on the predefined features.

## **Part 2: Defining the Product Epics**

Epics represent the major initiatives of the project. They are large-scale bodies of work that group related features and user stories. The epics for Project MechInterp Studio are mapped directly to the core functional blocks of the 7-step workflow and the essential supporting components like infrastructure and the user interface.

### **Epic 1: SAE Training and Dictionary Generation Pipeline**

**Goal:** To build the core offline pipeline that takes a raw LLM and a text corpus and produces a high-quality, monosemantic feature dictionary. This epic encompasses the most computationally intensive and data-heavy parts of the workflow (Steps 1 and 2). Its success is foundational to the entire platform, as the quality of the feature dictionary determines the quality of all subsequent interpretation and control capabilities. This work will draw heavily on research detailing the scaling challenges of SAE training and the methods to overcome them.4

### **Epic 2: Feature Explanation and Validation Engine**

**Goal:** To create an automated system that can analyze the raw features produced by Epic 1, generate human-readable explanations for what they represent, and quantitatively score the reliability of those explanations (Steps 3 and 4). This epic is about transforming abstract mathematical vectors into trustworthy, understandable concepts. The ability to assign a confidence score to each explanation is critical for building user trust and ensuring the reliability of the system's outputs.25

### **Epic 3: Real-Time Feature Monitoring and Correlation Service**

**Goal:** To develop the live, interactive components of the platform that allow developers and applications to "see" inside a running LLM (Steps 5 and 6). This includes building the backend for a "Gemma-Scope" like visualization tool and creating a robust API for applications to monitor for the activation of specific features in real-time. This epic's primary challenges are achieving low-latency responses and high-concurrency throughput to support real-time use cases like safety guardrails and content filtering.

### **Epic 4: Causal Intervention and Model Steering API**

**Goal:** To implement the most advanced and powerful capability of the platform: an API that allows developers to causally intervene in an LLM's generation process by directly manipulating feature activations (Step 7). This provides fine-grained control over model behavior, enabling applications to amplify desired traits (e.g., creativity, factuality) or suppress undesirable ones (e.g., bias, toxicity). This work involves deep, low-level integration with the model inference process.26

### **Epic 5: Core Infrastructure and Deployment Automation (CI/CD)**

**Goal:** To build the robust, automated, and scalable foundation upon which all services will be deployed and operated. This is a cross-cutting, non-functional epic that is mission-critical. It includes provisioning the Kubernetes cluster, deploying and configuring the Pulsar message bus and other databases, building automated CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment, and establishing the platform-wide monitoring and logging framework.3

### **Epic 6: Commercial User Interface and Visualization Tools**

**Goal:** To design and build the commercial front-end application that will serve as the primary interface for users. This application will consume the backend APIs developed in other epics to provide an intuitive and powerful experience for training, exploring, visualizing, monitoring, and steering LLMs. This epic focuses on user experience (UX), data visualization, and seamless integration with the backend services.4

## **Part 3: The Initial Product Backlog (Sprints 1-4)**

The initial product backlog focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure and building out the first two epics: the SAE Training Pipeline and the Feature Explanation Engine. This approach follows the principle of building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by first creating the core assets (the feature dictionary and explanations) before building the real-time tools that consume them.29

The user stories are crafted with an understanding that AI/ML development involves a mix of traditional software engineering, data engineering, and experimental research.29 Therefore, stories will be assigned to different personas (

Platform Engineer, Data Engineer, AI Developer, AI Researcher) to reflect the varied nature of the work. For tasks that are highly experimental, a "Hypothesis Story" format will be used to frame the work as a research spike, where the primary output is knowledge rather than a production feature.30 All stories will follow the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) to ensure they are well-defined and ready for development.32

    * THEN a new file (e.g., activations.pt) containing the serialized tensor of activation vectors is created in the output S3 bucket  
    * AND a log message is printed confirming the successful completion of the process.

### **3.2 Sprint 2: Building the SAE Training Service**

**Sprint Goal:** Develop the core SAE training service as a containerized job and orchestrate its execution on Kubernetes. This sprint focuses on creating a functional, repeatable training process.

**Features:**

* **F2.1: SAE Training Job Containerization**  
  * **User Story (AI Developer):** As an AI Developer, I want to package our SAE training script into a Docker container, so that it can be executed reliably, portably, and with all its dependencies managed across different environments.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria (BDD):**

    * AND the total amount of data read by all workers during the shuffle is significantly less than N times the total dataset size (demonstrating efficiency over a naive approach) 4  
    * AND a report is produced documenting the implementation, performance benchmarks, and a recommendation for its integration into the main training pipeline.

### **3.3 Sprint 3: Developing the Feature Activation and Explanation Service**

**Sprint Goal:** Build the services that consume a trained SAE to find what activates its features and then generate human-readable explanations for those activations.

**Features:**

* **F3.1: Top-K Activation Finder Service**  
  * **User Story (AI Developer):** As an AI Developer, I want to build a batch-processing service that takes a trained SAE and a text corpus, and for each feature in the SAE's dictionary, finds the top K text snippets that cause the highest activation, so that we have the raw data needed for generating explanations.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria (BDD):**  
    * GIVEN a trained SAE model artifact and a text corpus are available in object storage

* **F3.2: Feature Explanation Service API**  
  * **User Story (AI Developer):** As an AI Developer, I want to create a microservice with a secure API endpoint that accepts a set of text snippets and orchestrates a call to a powerful external LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate a concise, structured explanation of the common concept they share.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria (BDD):**  
    * GIVEN the Feature Explanation Service is deployed and running in the cluster  
    * WHEN an authenticated client sends a POST request to the /v1/explain endpoint with a JSON payload containing { "feature\_id": 123, "snippets": \["text1", "text2",...\] }

    * AND the response body is a JSON object containing the explanation in a structured format: { "feature\_id": 123, "explanation": "...", "category": "high-level", "score": null } as described in recent research.25

### **3.4 Sprint 4: Implementing the Explanation Scoring and Validation Loop**

**Sprint Goal:** Close the initial interpretation loop by building the service that programmatically scores the quality and reliability of the generated explanations, providing a crucial measure of trust.

**Features:**

* **F4.1: Synthetic Sentence Generator**  
  * **User Story (AI Developer):** As an AI Developer, I want to create an internal service function that takes a feature's text explanation (e.g., "concepts related to maritime law") and uses an LLM to generate a set of new, synthetic sentences that exemplify that concept.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria (BDD):**  
    * GIVEN the input explanation is "concepts related to the Golden Gate Bridge" 28  
    * WHEN the sentence generation function is called  
    * THEN it returns a list of diverse, grammatically correct sentences such as "We drove across the iconic red bridge at sunset," "The fog often obscures the view from the bridge's towers," and "Construction of the suspension bridge was a major engineering feat."  
* **F4.2: Explanation Scoring Service**  
  * **User Story (AI Researcher):** As an AI Researcher, I want to implement the full scoring logic that orchestrates sentence generation and activation checking to assign a quantitative confidence score to a feature's explanation, so that we can programmatically validate and rank the quality of our feature interpretations.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria (BDD):**  
    * GIVEN a feature (e.g., feature\_42), its corresponding SAE, and its generated explanation in the database  
    * WHEN the scoring service is triggered for feature\_42  
    * THEN the service generates a set of synthetic sentences based on the explanation  
    * AND it calculates the activation value of feature\_42 for each synthetic sentence  
    * AND it computes an aggregate confidence score (e.g., on a 1-5 scale) based on how strongly the synthetic sentences activate the feature 25  
    * AND the score is persisted to the PostgreSQL database, updating the record for that feature's explanation.

## **Part 4: Deployment and Operations Strategy**

A robust deployment and operations strategy is essential for managing the complexity of a microservices-based AI platform. The strategy will prioritize automation, consistency, and observability, leveraging the full power of cloud-native tooling.

### **4.1 Containerization Strategy**

All microservices and batch jobs will be packaged as Docker containers to ensure consistency and portability across development, testing, and production environments.7

* **Base Images:** A set of standardized, minimal base images will be maintained. For Python services, this means using official slim images (e.g., python:3.9-slim-bullseye) and employing multi-stage builds. The first stage will compile any necessary dependencies, and the final stage will copy only the required artifacts, resulting in a smaller, more secure production image.6  
* **Dependency Management:** Python dependencies will be strictly managed via version-pinned requirements.txt files. To optimize build times, the Dockerfile will copy the requirements.txt file and run pip install in a separate layer before copying the application source code. This leverages Docker's layer caching, so dependencies are only re-installed when the requirements file changes.6  
* **Configuration:** No configuration will be hardcoded into container images. All configuration parameters, such as database connection strings, API keys, and service endpoints, will be supplied via environment variables. In Kubernetes, these will be managed using ConfigMaps and Secrets, which are then injected into the pods at runtime.6

### **4.2 Orchestration Manifests**

The platform will be orchestrated primarily using Kubernetes, with example manifests provided for Docker Swarm for parity as requested. The Kubernetes manifests will be our source of truth for deployments, managed via a GitOps workflow.

### **4.3 Monitoring and Logging Framework**

A comprehensive observability strategy is not an afterthought but a core requirement for managing a distributed AI system. The framework will provide insights into both system health and model behavior.

* **Centralized Logging:** All microservices will be instrumented to output structured logs (e.g., JSON format) to stdout and stderr. A log aggregation agent, such as **Fluentd**, will be deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet to collect logs from all nodes. These logs will be forwarded to a centralized, searchable backend. Depending on the scale and query needs, this will be either the **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack** or the more lightweight **Loki**, which integrates seamlessly with Grafana.3  
* **Metrics and Monitoring:**  
  * **System & Application Metrics:** **Prometheus** will be the standard for collecting time-series metrics. All services will expose a /metrics endpoint in the Prometheus format. The Kubernetes API server, nodes (via node-exporter), and other infrastructure components will also be scraped. **Grafana** will be used to build dashboards for visualizing key metrics like CPU/memory utilization, API latency, error rates, and queue depths in Pulsar.6  
  * **Model Behavior Monitoring:** This is where the platform's unique value is operationalized. The Feature Monitoring Service (Step 6\) will not only provide an API but also act as a critical component of our internal MLOps. It will subscribe to real-time activation streams from Pulsar. When it detects the activation of specific, pre-identified features (e.g., a feature for "toxic language" or a feature for "security risk"), it will increment a corresponding Prometheus counter (e.g., mechinterp\_feature\_activation\_total{feature="toxicity\_v1"}). This allows the operations team to build Grafana dashboards that monitor the *semantic behavior* of the LLM in production, triggering alerts if certain undesirable concepts are being activated too frequently. This closes the loop on the entire workflow, transforming an interpretability tool into a live, powerful MLOps monitoring and safety system.
